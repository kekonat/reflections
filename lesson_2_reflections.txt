What happens when you nitialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

We need to initilize a repository to tell get we want to keep track of these files.
If we do not do this, git will have to keep track of EVERYTHING we have.
We don't want this.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think that the staging area is for us to explicitly remind ourselves what we are currently working on.
We should not be adding multiple files into the staging area if they do not logically belong together.
